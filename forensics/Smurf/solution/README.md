## Write-up

Let's extract the the raw data from ICMP packets using `Scapy`

```python
f = rdpcap('Desktop/smurf.pcapng')

for ff in f:
  print(ff.load.decode('utf8'))
  ```
Output: hexadecimal values.

Rickroll ( ͡• ͜ʖ ͡• ), Let's try another way.

As we can see, there is a specious `ID` field in `packet info` in wireshark.
![IMG](./id.png)
we can check it out using `Scapy` again:
```python
flag =''
for ff in f:
    flag = flag + str(ff['ICMP'].id) + " "
print(flag)
```
output:
```code
'115 104 101 108 108 109 97 116 101 115 123 121 48 117 95 52 114 51 95 116 104 51 95 53 109 117 114 102 95 99 104 52 109 112 125 '
```
After decoding these decimal values you will get the flag:


## Flag

`shellmates{y0u_4r3_th3_5murf_ch4mp}`
