  > Alice and Bob were playing rock paper scissors.   
  > They forget to calculate the score at each round.   
  > Can you help them you determine the winner at the end of each game.
  > The rules are simple:
  > In each round if a player wins, he gets 3 points.  
  > If he wins in the next round he gets the double of the point he got in the last round.  
  > In case of draw, both players will get 1 point.  
  > the output format will be the first letter of the player's name (A or B) followed   
  > by the score he got example : 'A:1337' Alice won and got 1337 points.  
  > in case of a drawn game just print 'D'
